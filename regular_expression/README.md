# 🔤 Python Character Occurrence Counter

A simple yet powerful Python program that allows users to:

- Enter a **sentence**
- Enter a **character**
- Count **how many times** that character appears (case‑insensitive)
- Get a message if the character is **not found**
- Choose to **run again (Enter)** or **exit (Esc)**
- Prevent invalid key presses with friendly error messages

Perfect for practicing string processing, loops, and user-input validation.
